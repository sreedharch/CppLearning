Interfaces in C++ (Abstract Classes):
  C++ interfaces are implemented using abstract classes and these abstract classes should not be confused with data abstraction which is a concept of keeping implementation details separate from associated data.
  A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as pure virtual function.
  Abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects and serves only as an interface.
  Classes that can be used to instantiate objects are called concrete classes.
