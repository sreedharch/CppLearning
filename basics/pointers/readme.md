A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.
type *var-name;

following are few important pointer concepts:
  Null Pointers
  main.cpp.3
    A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
    
  Pointer Arithmetic
  main.cpp.4, main.cpp.5, main.cpp.6
    There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, and -
    
  Pointers vs Arrays
  main.cpp.4
  
  Array of Pointers
  main.cpp.7, main.cpp.8
  
  Pointer to Pointer
  main.cpp.9
    Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value
  
  Passing Pointers to Functions
  main.cpp.10, main.cpp.11
  
  Return Pointer from Functions
  main.cpp.12
