C++ allows you to specify more than one definition for a function name or an operator in the same scope, which is called function overloading and operator overloading
Function Overloading:
  main.cpp.1
  multiple definitions for the same function name in the same scope.
  The definition of the function must differ from each other by the types and/or the number of arguments in the argument list. You cannot overload function declarations that differ only by return type.

Operators Overloading:
  main.cpp.2
  
Unary Operators Overloading:
main.cpp.3
	examples of Unary operators
		The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
		The unary minus (-) operator.
		The logical not (!) operator.
		
Binary Operators Overloading:
main.cpp.4
	The binary operators take two arguments
	use binary operators like addition (+) operator, subtraction (-) operator and division (/) operator

Relational Operators Overloading:
